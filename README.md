The image shows a scatter plot comparing day-ahead electricity prices (x-axis) with hourly imbalance prices (y-axis) for the electricity market in the Netherlands. Period 2015-april 2024.
The majority of the data points cluster around the origin, suggesting that for most hours, the day-ahead and imbalance prices are relatively close or balanced. However, there are many outliers where the imbalance price deviates significantly, both higher and lower, from the day-ahead price.

The outliers seem to follow a somewhat fan-shaped pattern, with the spread of imbalance prices increasing as the day-ahead price gets higher, indicating more potential for large imbalances or price spikes at higher day-ahead price levels.

Overall, the chart illustrates the relationship and potential deviations between forecast day-ahead prices used for scheduling and actual real-time imbalance prices that account for unforeseen supply/demand mismatches in the electricity market over the analysis period.
